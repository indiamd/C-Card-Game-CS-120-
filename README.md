**Summary:** \
This program simulates a card game that involves guessing from the user.
A random card is drawn with a suit and num (ex: 7 of Diamonds), which will have a corresponding total value.
The user guesses whether the next random card drawn will have a higher or lower value than the first.
The second card is drawn, the value is revealed, the card values are compared,
and the player finds out if they were correct.
If the player is correct, they get a point and the game continues.
If incorrect, the game ends and the player receives their final score.

**In the Future:** \
If I had more time to work on the project, it would be interesting to make it a two player game.
It could run twice and see which player got a higher score. 
It could also be more interesting to allow the player to guess if it would be "way higher" or just "higher"
and by guessing more specific answers, they could get more points for taking a risk.
